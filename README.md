this repository held my homepage used from 2019 / 2020.   
It is no longer in use tho, since ya girl moved on and already starts to neglect her new page.  
Who could have seen that coming lol :D  
But here's to a future full of new projects, more time and the neverending willingness to learn and try new things.  

Till then, i will meet you there.
